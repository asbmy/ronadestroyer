Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser using PIC18F Microcontroller

* Programming Language: C
* Microcontroller: PIC18F4580 
* Tools: Proteus Design Suite

The system squeezes the hand sanitizer by electric motors after detecting the human’s hand via available sensors, in the event that the hand sanitizer is finished, the system will flash yellow LED to remind the premise owner that it needs to be replaced.

## Problem Statement

There is a lot of hand sanitizer being used currently in shops and restaurants during the government sanctioned PKP or MCO. Hand sanitizers are used to kill the virus before entering the premises. However, the handle on the bottle may be contaminated and visitors need to share the same pen to write down their credentials before entering, thus there is a need to automate the whole process in order to reduce human contamination.

How do we automate the whole process of squeezing the hand sanitizer and remind the premise that the content has run dry in order to reduce human contact and to ensure that the viruses does not infect the innocent ones?

## Objective

1. To reduce Human Contact with the Sanitizer bottle
2. To alert the premise that the hand sanitizer bottle is going empty
3. To squeeze the sanitizer bottle to disperse the content on the human’s hand

## Scope

* A single 500ml liquid base hand sanitizer
* A single LED alert system
* A single person at a time
* A single PIC18F4580 microcontroller will be used
* Virtual Prototype using these components:
* Ultrasonic sensor
* Brushless motor
